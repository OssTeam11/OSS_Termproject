# OUTLINE
I made a program related to self-driving cars.
It recognizes a person's face as a frame through a webcam and outputs a signal that stops the car or slows down if the frame size is more than a certain degree.

When the program is executed, the webcam is turned on to recognize a person's face as a frame and output a warning according to its size.
Press any key to exit the program.
